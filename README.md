# [SteemAX](https://steemax.trade)

SteemAX helps minnow content-creators and whale curators by automating an exchange of upvotes between their quality [Steemit](https://www.steemit.com) blog posts, allowing both a 1 to 1 as well as disproportional exchanges that grant bigger curations, better support than a bid bot, and the long-term support they both deserve.

SteemAX uses Python 3.5, MySQL and the [SimpleSteem](https://github.com/artolabs/simplesteem) library to utilize the [Steemit/Steem](https://github.com/steemit/steem) blockchain technology.

### Requirements

You must have a [Steemit account](https://www.steemit.com), a social media platform that grants the cryptocurrency Steem as a reward for upvoting good content. SteemAX uses [Steem Connect](https://www.steemconnect.com) to authenticate a Steemit password and gain authority to cast votes.

### Use

Simply visit [SteemAX.trade](http://steemax.trade) and log in using your Steemit password via Steem Connect. Once you have logged in for the first time and created your SteemAX account you can then visit SteemAX.*info* (SteemAX.info/@your-steemit-account-name) to see your pending exchange invites.

# Development

SteemAX is currently in the beta testing phase as new features are being constantly added and refined through user feedback. Please contact Mike-A on the [ArtoLabs discord server](https://discord.gg/97GKVFC) if you have found a bug, have any questions or useful feedback abut SteemAX, both negative and positive.
